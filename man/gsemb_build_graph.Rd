\title{Build a PPI graph adjacency matrix}
\usage{
gsemb_build_graph(
  edges,
  node1 = "node1",
  node2 = "node2",
  weight = NULL,
  directed = FALSE,
  nodes = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{A data.frame containing at least two columns for endpoints.}

\item{node1, node2}{Column names in \code{edges} for source/target.}

\item{weight}{Optional column name in \code{edges} providing edge weights.}

\item{directed}{Logical; whether to keep the graph directed.}

\item{nodes}{Optional character vector of node IDs to keep/order.}
}
\value{
A sparse adjacency matrix of class \code{dgCMatrix}.
}
\description{
Construct a sparse adjacency matrix from an edge list. Node names are stored
in the matrix dimnames and are used throughout the package.
