\title{Compute distances between two collections of gene clusters}
\usage{
gsemb_cluster_similarity(
  x,
  clusters,
  other_clusters = NULL,
  metric = c("w2", "sym_kl"),
  eps = 1e-08,
  min_size = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `gsemb_embedding` object.}

\item{clusters}{Named list of character vectors (gene IDs).}

\item{other_clusters}{Optional second named list of clusters.}

\item{metric}{Distance metric: `"w2"` or `"sym_kl"`.}

\item{eps}{Lower bound for variances.}

\item{min_size}{Minimum number of genes per cluster after intersecting with the embedding.}
}
\value{
A numeric distance matrix (clusters x other_clusters).
}
\description{
Gene clusters are represented as diagonal Gaussians fitted from member genes
in the learned gene embedding.
