\title{Fit diagonal Gaussian embeddings for gene sets from member genes}
\usage{
gsemb_fit_set_gaussians_from_members(gene_embedding, gene_sets, eps = 1e-08)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_embedding}{Numeric matrix of gene embeddings (genes in rows).}

\item{gene_sets}{Named list of character vectors (gene IDs).}

\item{eps}{Lower bound for variances; also used when a set has only one member.}
}
\value{
A list with `mu` and `var` matrices (sets in rows).
}
\description{
Compute mean and diagonal variance of member gene embeddings for each set.
